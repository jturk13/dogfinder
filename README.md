I was tasked to build an app that routes to different dogs and displays information on that dog when you’re at that route.

The routes should look like this:

- */dogs* is the homepage and shows all three dogs
- Clicking on a dog from the homepage takes you to that dog’s route. For example, clicking on Whiskey will take you to */dogs/whiskey*.
- every other endpoint not listed should redirect you to */dogs.*
